          </h1>
          <p class="mb-0">AnywAIR recognizes its responsibility to help protect personally identifiable information
            collected about visitors to the anywAIR website. This Privacy Policy describes the personally identifiable
            information we collect online and how we use and protect this information.</p>

            <h2>COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</h2>
            <p class="mb-small">We collect personally identifiable information when you complete online forms on this
              website. The types of personally identifiable information that we collect include: first and last name;
              home and email addresses; and telephone number. We may also collect additional personally identifiable
              information if you choose to respond to a voluntary customer survey or enter a sweepstakes or contest
              offered through this site, or if you request changes to your service through one of our customer service
              representatives. We also will collect your email address if you choose to ask a question or provide
              feedback online.</p>
            <p class="mb-small">We also may collect non-personally identifiable information when you visit this website.
              When you access the anywAIR Internet portal page or other anywAIR websites, anywAIR and its affiliates, partners,
              and advertisers may place small text files or “cookies” on your computer’s hard drive. These cookies,
              which store only the zip code you have entered, provide information about your activities on our site so
              that we may provide you with customized content and facilitate your use of the site. Third parties,
              including our affiliates, partners, and advertisers, may also place cookies on your computer. These
              cookies collect anonymous information in order to provide information about goods and services that may be
              of interest to you. Accepting all cookies is voluntary, and you may still use this site if you decline our
              cookies – although you may not be able to access certain services that we offer. You can also manually
              delete cookies once they are placed onto your computer. Consult your web browser for instructions on how
              to decline and/or delete cookies.</p>
            <p class="mb-small">We may also collect information about your interests when you choose to click on links
              in the commercial e-mail messages that we send you. AnywAIR does not collect any information that you provide
              when you visit a particular website; we simply seek to understand the links that you found of interest in
              our commercial e-mail messages so that we can send you information that may be of interest. AnywAIR also does
              not collect personally identifiable information through this process unless you voluntarily provide it
              (such as through a sweepstakes entry form), and you can choose not to receive any commercial e-mail
              messages we send through opt-out links that are provided in every such message.</p>
            <p>AnywAIR does not routinely monitor the activity of user accounts except for measurements of system
              utilization, general statistical analyses, and the preparation of billing records and logs, which result
              in the gathering of minimal personally identifiable information, including names and e-mail addresses of
              visitors to this website.</p>
            <h2>USE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>We use the personally identifiable information we collect to make sure you receive the products and
              services you requested; to send your bills and credit you for payments; to respond promptly to your
              questions, complaints, and requests for changes in service; to help resolve any service or maintenance
              problems; to protect the security of our equipment and services; to ensure compliance with applicable
              laws; to prevent the unauthorized reception of service; and to investigate activity that violates our
              Terms and Conditions. We may also use your personally identifiable information to send you program or
              service listings, new product or service offerings, special announcements, and other information we think
              you may want on behalf of anywAIR or third parties. We do not disclose any of your personally identifiable
              information when we send you information on behalf of third parties, and you can always choose to opt out
              of receiving commercial e- mail announcements that we send about our own products or services or those of
              third parties by clicking on the opt-out link provided in every such e-mail communication.</p>
            <h2>DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>AnywAIR will not disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties for purposes unrelated
              to those for which the information was collected without your permission except to respond to proper
              requests for information from government or judicial officials investigating illegal activity, in the
              event of bankruptcy or a sale of substantially all or some of the assets of anywAIR, to protect the personal
              safety of its subscribers or the public, to protect and defend the rights or property of anywAIR or our
              subscribers, or to otherwise comply with the law. AnywAIR may share your personally identifiable information
              with entities affiliated with us through common ownership or control.</p>
            <h2> RIGHT TO REVIEW AND UPDATE PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>We will maintain personally identifiable information about you only so long as it is necessary for the
              purpose for which it was collected or to comply with laws governing our business. This period of time
              could be as long as seven years for our tax and accounting needs. Thereafter, such information will be
              destroyed unless there are legitimate pending requests for access to such information.</p>
            <h2>SECURITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>AnywAIR highly prioritizes the security of your personally identifiable information. While no website can
              guarantee security, we employ security technologies and procedures to help protect the confidentiality of
              your personally identifiable information.</p>
            <h2>CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</h2>
            <p>Our website is a general audience site, and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable
              information from children under thirteen years of age. If, as a part of future service offerings, we
              decide to request personally identifiable information from children under thirteen, we will require
              verifiable parental consent before we collect this information as required by applicable law. Should a
              child whom we know to be under thirteen send personal information to us, we will use that information only
              to respond to that child to inform him or her that we must have parental consent before receiving his or
              her personal information.</p>
            <h2>THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES</h2>
            <p>There are several places throughout our website where you may accept a link to other websites that do not
              operate under our privacy practices. When you click through to these websites, our privacy policies and
              practices no longer apply. We recommend that you examine the privacy policies of all third-party websites
              before engaging in any transactions with them to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and
              disclosing your information.</p>
            <h2>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
            <p>We may modify or update our services from time to time, and if necessary, the provisions of this privacy
              statement. In the case of material changes to our privacy practices, we will post changes to our privacy
              policy here for a period of time before such changes become effective.</p>
            <h2>CONTACT US</h2>
            <p class="mb-small">If you have questions about this Privacy Statement or any other services we provide,
              please contact us. This website is intended for use by residents of the United States who are over 18
              years of age.</p>
            <p class="mb-small">There are several places throughout our website where you may accept a link to other
              websites that do not operate under our privacy practices. When you click through to these websites, our
              privacy policies and practices no longer apply. We recommend that you examine the privacy policies of all
              third-party websites before engaging in any transactions with them to understand their procedures for
              collecting, using, and disclosing your information.</p>
            <p class="mb-small">CUSTOMER PROPRIETARY NETWORK INFORMATION (“CPNI”)</p>
            <p class="mb-small">Another aspect of anywAIR’s privacy policy relates exclusively to phone information.
              Federal regulations require that a company providing voice services inform its customers regarding
              specific protections it establishes for information about the quantity, technical configuration, type,
              destination, location, and amount of a service used by customers as well as other information contained in
              the phone bill pertaining to the service received by the customer such as charges and account number. This
              information when associated with a particular customer is known as “Customer Proprietary Network
              Information” or “CPNI”. It does not include names, addresses and telephone numbers (unless unlisted)
              because such information is generally publicly available. In addition, it does not include aggregate
              information of many customers so long as it does not identify any particular customer.</p>
            <p class="mb-small">In order to protect the confidentiality of your CPNI, we have instituted the following
              procedures. We follow standard security practices in the industry. We have technical responses in place to
              resist brute force attacks on our servers as well as other outside attacks on the security of our data. We
              have taken steps to secure the physical location of our data from all outsiders as well as non-authorized
              individuals within anywAIR. Policies in place impose restrictions on the use and disclosure of customer
              information, and training is in place to disseminate these policies and refresh them. Of course, no amount
              of prudent and careful security measures can completely guarantee that every unauthorized attempt to
              access CPNI will be driven back.</p>
            <p class="mb-small">To add another layer of protection, we will not disclose your CPNI to anyone outside of
              anywAIR without your consent. This includes company affiliates, unless you are also a customer of that
              affiliate. If we receive a call from someone purporting to be you, we will not release your CPNI over the
              phone, but will require the caller to make the request in person at a local anywAIR office in order to
              confirm identity. If you are a anywAIR Internet customer, you may access your CPNI online with a user ID and
              password. If you call to discuss your own CPNI, we will review it with you but we will not discuss any of
              your protected information that you do not reveal to us.</p>
            <p class="mb-small">We may use or disclose your CPNI without your permission for limited reasons such as to
              provide necessary services and support such as maintenance and billing for the phone service you currently
              have as well as market new or additional adjunct offerings for the phone service you currently have such
              as call blocking and caller ID. We may also disclose your CPNI in response to a proper legal demand for
              the information and to protect anywAIR, its customers or other parties against fraudulent, abusive or
              unlawful use of its services.</p>
            <p>While the rules regarding CPNI prohibit the use of CPNI in marketing campaigns without your consent, we
              have elected not to use CPNI for marketing. Should that decision change, we will notify you and provide
              you with the opportunity to grant or deny consent to our use of your CPNI in our marketing campaigns.</p>
            <h2>DO NOT CALL POLICY</h2>
            <p class="mb-small">As part of its general business practice and in compliance with laws and regulations
              governing telemarketing and consumers’ rights to privacy, anywAIR has instituted the following Do Not Call
              policy.</p>
            <p class="mb-small">It is the policy of anywAIR that outbound sales calls will not be made to any person who
              has communicated a desire to us not to receive telephone solicitations or to any person who is on a state
              or federal Do Not Call list, except as permitted by law. The company reserves the right to make telephone
              solicitations in the absence of notification.</p>
            <p class="mb-small">AnywAIR maintains a record of the name and telephone number(s) for consumers who do not
              wish to be called or contacted. AnywAIR and its agents use this internal list as well as the National Do Not
              Call list and relevant state Do Not Call lists to prevent calls to individuals on these lists. At least
              quarterly, anywAIR or its telemarketing agents check and update the internal list against all relevant state
              and federal Do Not Call registries.</p>
            <p class="mb-small">You may contact anywAIR, either by phone or in writing, to request to be added to our Do
              Not Call list. Whether you call or write, you must specifically request to be placed on AnywAIR’s Do Not Call
              list and provide your name, address and all telephone number(s) you wish to be included in the list. Your
              number will be placed on our Do Not Call list within five (5) days of receipt.</p>
            <p class="mb-small">Please notify us if there are any changes to your telephone number during that time. If
              you obtain a new telephone number, you must give us that new number if you want your “do not call” status
              to remain in effect.</p>
            <p class="mb-small">Please note that the law permits anywAIR to contact its customers for non-solicitation
              purposes, such as surveys, billing issues or service-related matters.</p>
            <p>Customers may request a copy of this Policy by contacting anywAIR.</p>
